How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

  For this project I created an inteligent agent for a game. The agent was a prirate in this case that had to navigate a grid like enviornment. The environment had multiple obstiles that created a bit of a challenge factor. I was given the PY files that included the enviornment and also the file that would hold the data learned in the training. 
  Computer scientists have the ability to do so many things. They are able to develope code that makes a differnce in a program. The program range from something simple to something life changing. A computer scientisst also has a broad understanding of everything that goes into the technology being used. Though the coding aspect is important there is so much more. Being able to comunicate with the whole team to make things as perfect as they can be is another. For instance, if the developer doesn't comunicate with the tester how would they know what area of the code may need to be debugged.
